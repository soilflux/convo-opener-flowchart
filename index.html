      <u>HRU OPENER</u> (best, very polite)<br>
      > <b>something of substance about yourself, hru</b><br>
      --best response. this opens up your friend to both respond to something you care about and talk about themselves.<br>
      > <b>good, hru</b><br>
      --poor response. this will pressure your friend to say something of substance about themselves AND ask you a riskier question in order to keep the convo from being one-sided.<br>
      > <b>something of substance about yourself</b><br>
      --bad response. this will make the convo one-sided.<br>
      > <b>good</b><br>
      --terrible response. pushes away your friend.<br>
      <br>
      <u>SWEET or FUNNY or CUTE WELL WISHES OPENER</u> (best, very polite. only to be used when the relationship is already saturated with enough conversation)<br>
      ><b>thx, u2</b><br>
      --best response. it's implicated that they want to give love but may not be interested in having a convo.<br>
      ><b>thx, u2, hru</b><br>
      --fair response. iffy because if they wanted a conversation and they knew what they were doing, they would have led with hru.<br>
      <br>
      <u>SWEET or FUNNY or CUTE HRU OPENER</u> (good, polite. counterintuitively a little worse than just hru, save for later)<br>
      ><b>same as hru but show appreciation obvs</b><br>
      <br>
      <u>SWEET or FUNNY or CUTE OPENER</u> (fair, didn't check on them)<br>
      ><b>same as hi but show appreciation obvs</b><br>
      <br>
      <u>TALK ABOUT SELF HRU OPENER</u> (poor, impolite(selfish) but it's the quickest opening)<br>
      ><b>respond to their stuff and ask questions about it, then say something of substance about yourself</b><br>
      --best response, keeps the conversation going and keeps it even.<br>
      ><b>respond to their stuff and ask questions about it, good</b><br>
      --bad response, makes convo one-sided<br>
      <br>
      <u>WYD OPENER</u> (poor, impolite(bc it's nosy) and if your friend knows how to conversate it does nothing that hru doesn't)<br>
      ><b>same as hru</b><br>
      <br>
      <u>HI OPENER</u> (poor, wastes time)<br>
      ><b>hi, hru</b><br>
      --best response. opens the way your friend should have.<br> 
      ><b>hi</b><br>
      --fair response. wastes time, but mirrors your friend.<br>
      ><b>hi, talk about yourself, hru</b><br>
      --poor response. treats it as if they opened with hru. selfish and awkward.<br>
      ><b>hi, talk about yourself</b><br>
      --bad response. awkward and makes the convo one-sided.<br>
      <br>
      <u>TALK ABOUT SELF OPENER</u> (bad, impolite(selfish and you didn't check on friend) but it's the quickest opening)<br>
      ><b>respond, relate it to something about yourself</b><br>
      --best response. balances out the convo. <br>
      ><b>respond, don't ask questions</b><br>
      --fair response. convo remains one-sided but this can help it end quicker.<br>
      ><b>respond, ask questions</b><br>
      --poor response, one-sided.<br>
